# BDR: Block Device Replicator

## Introduction
BDR (Block Device Replicator) is a real-time, network-based block device replication solution designed for Linux. BDR observes writes made to a specified device and sends them over the network to a designated destination, where the receiver daemon writes them to a backup deviceâ€”essentially mirroring RAID 1 functionality. BDR is best suited for disks with low workloads or slower disks, as the kernel can process data faster than the user-space daemon. When buffer from which userspace daemon is taking the writes from overflows, a complete disk scan is necessary. At the start of the client daemon it performs complete disk scan to ensure consistency. The initial scan can be turned off if you are sure that devices are identical (not advised).

## Reqirements

* GNU Make
* Linux Kernel >= 6.8
* Linux Kernel Headers
* go >= 1.23.0

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the BDR repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JUaHELE/bdr.git
```

### Build the Kernel Driver

Navigate to the kern directory and build the kernel driver and load it into the kernel:

```bash
cd kern/
make
sudo insmod bdr.ko
```

### Build the usespace daemons

```bash
cd user/go/client
go build

cd user/go/server
go build
```
